# Deques-and-Randomized-Queues-Assignment
An assignment from Coursera learning platform in Algorithms part 1 course .

# Randomized queue
A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random from items in the data structure. A resizing array approach was used to implement the structure.

# Deque
A double-ended queue  is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. The implemantion used a doubly linked list approach.


# Permutation Client
Created to test the implementation of the randomized queue. It takes a command-line integer k; reads in a sequence of n strings and prints exactl k of them, uniformly at random.

# Etxernal Libraries used
alg4.jar- this is a tailor made library from coursera.
